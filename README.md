# Airbnb_Marketing_Analysis

I conducted research and wrote a report for a client, delving into the analysis of various marketing metrics that can be tracked and used for marketing analysis for Airbnb. The research aims to provide an examination of key marketing indicators for Airbnb, utilizing an Airbnb New York City dataset across five major neighborhood groups: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Staten Island, the Bronx, and Queens.

This was done by making use of a dashboard, I built using Tableau. 
Attached below is the link to the report and dashboard.
